 key properties of bitcoin

 limited supply  there will only ever be a maximum of  bitcoins createdhttpswwwredditcomrbitcoincommentshathisishowweknowtheresonlymillionbitcoin and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the inflation schedulehttpsbashcogithubiobitcoinmonetaryinflation  once they are all issued bitcoin will be truly deflationary  the halving countdownhttpbitcoinblockhalfcom tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving
 open source  bitcoin code is fully auditable  you can read and contribute to the source codehttpsgithubcombitcoinbitcoin yourself
 accountable  the public ledger is transparent all transactions are seen by everyonehttpsblockstreaminfo
 decentralized  bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such cant be shut down similar to how bittorrenthttpsenwikipediaorgwikibittorrent works  you can even run a node on a raspberry pihttpsgetumbrelcom  
 censorship resistant  no one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor alter or block transactions that they disagree with see operation chokepointhttpsenwikipediaorgwikioperationchokepoint
 push system  there are no chargebackshttpsgendalmelessonsfrombitcoinpushversuspull in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them
 borderless  no country can stop it from going inout even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is globally distributedhttpsbitnodesionodeslivemap
 trustless  bitcoin solved the byzantines generals problemhttpsenwikipediaorgwikibyzantinefaulttolerance which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work
 pseudonymous  no need to expose personal informationhttpsbuybitcoinworldwidecomanonymity when purchasing with cash or transacting 
 secure  blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured using hashes and signatures and cant be brute forcedhttpiimgurcomfyfbsqpjpg or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets
 programmable  individual units of bitcoin can be programmed to transferhttpsenbitcoinitwikiscript based on certain criteria being met
 divisible  each bitcoin can be divided down to  decimalshttpsenbitcoinitwikisatoshiunit which means you dont have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin 
 nearly instant  from a few seconds on the lightning network to a few minuteshttpswwwblockchaincomchartsmedianconfirmationtime onchain depending on need for confirmations  transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone including miners after  confirmations 
 peertopeer  no intermediaries taking a cut no need for trusted third partieshttpsnakamotoinstituteorgtrustedthirdparties
 designed money  bitcoin was created to fit all the fundamental properties of moneyhttpsimgurcomawla better than gold or fiat
 portable  bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold  they can be transported by simply carrying a seed a string of  to  words on a device or by memorizing it for wallet recoveryhttpsenbitcoinitwikibrainwallet while cool memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users  hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security
 low fee scaling  most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view fee estimateshttpsrivercomlearnhowbitcoinfeeswork and mempool activityhttpsjochenhoenickedequeuew if you want to set your fee manually  on chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the lightning networkhttpslightningnetwork an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the bitcoin blockchain the lightning network enables bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible
 scalable  while the protocol is still being optimized for increased transaction capacityhttpsenbitcoinitwikiscalability blockchains do not scale very well so most transaction volume is expected to occur on layer  networks built on top of bitcoin

note bitcoin are valued at whatever market pricehttpsaggrtrademh people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand unlike traditional markets bitcoin markets operate  hours per day  days per year 

 securing your bitcoin

with bitcoin you can be your own bank and personally secure your bitcoin or you can use third party companies aka bitcoin banks which will hold your bitcoin for you

 if you prefer to be your own bank and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure if you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices then a hardware wallet such as a bitboxhttpsbitboxswissbitbox  trezorhttpswwwtrezorio coldcardhttpscoldcardwalletcom or blockstream jadehttpsblockstreamcomjade is recommended you can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a seedsignerhttpsseedsignercom or kruxhttpsselfcustodygithubiokrux

 if you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many software wallethttpsbitcoinorgenchooseyourwallet options to choose from depending on your use case  mobile wallets like bluewallethttpsbluewalletio are generally more secure than desktop wallets  beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable bitcoin websites  avoid paper wallets or brain wallets

 if you prefer to work with third party bitcoin banks to set up a collaborative custody arrangement try unchained capitalhttpsunchainedcapitalcom but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk  there is a saying in the community not your keys not your coins 

note for increased security use two factor authentication fa everywhere it is offered including email 

fa requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access  google authenticator and authy are the two most popular fa services download links are below  make sure you create backups of your fa codes

avoid using your cell number for fa  hackers have been using a technique called sim swapping to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges

google auth  authy  otp auth 

androidhttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomgoogleandroidappsauthenticator  androidhttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomauthyauthyhlen  na 
ioshttpsitunesapplecomusappgoogleauthenticatoridmt  ioshttpsitunesapplecomusappauthyid  ioshttpsappsapplecomusappotpauthid  

physical security keys fido uf offer stronger security than google auth  authy and other totpbased apps because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bidirectional authentication so it prevents phishing if you lose the device though you could lose access to your account so always use  or more security keys with a given account so you have backups see yubikeyhttpsyubikeycom or titanhttpscloudgooglecomtitansecuritykey to purchase security keys

 running bitcoin

you can run bitcoin nodehttpsbitcoinstackexchangecomquestionswhatisabitcoinnode software by downloading and installing bitcoin corehttpsbitcoincoreorg or other node software you have vetted 

it is a best practice to verify these bitcoin node programs you download by checking their hashes and signatureshttpsyoutubeuiimsrosiqagrygpurzqacm 

dont trust verify

 httpsgithubcombitcoinbitcoinreleases
 httpsbitcoincoreorg
 httpsbitcoinorgenbitcoincore

a verified bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the bitcoin network they can be used alongside open source software walletshttpsenbitcoinitwikiwallet to send and receive bitcoin securely by running your own bitcoin node you enforce the bitcoin ruleset can verify transactions without trusted rd party middlemen improve your bitcoin privacy obtain independence with local access to blockchain data and help bolster the robustness of the bitcoin network by running a bitcoin node you are verifying that bitcoin is bitcoin for yourself for more details on running a bitcoin node see this articlehttpsunchainedcomblogwhyrunbitcoinnode 

for wallets used alongside your bitcoin node if your bitcoin wallet software is fully open sourcehttpsbitcoinstackexchangecomquestionsisbitcoincompletelyopensource and bitcoinonly then it is probably a decent wallet some popular examples include sparrow wallethttpssparrowwalletcom and electrum wallethttpselectrumorg both of which you can connect to your own locally run bitcoin node and use with most bitcoin hardware wallets

 watch out for scams

as mentioned above bitcoin is decentralized which by definition means there is no official website or twitter handle or spokesperson or ceo however all money attracts thieves this combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on youtube or social media many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of bitcoin websites like bitcoindotcom and the r  btc subreddit are active scams  almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin  so be careful any resource including all linked in this document may in the future turn evil  as they say in our community dont trust verify 

 avoid using adbased search engines like google or yahoo ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways  use duckduckgohttpsduckduckgocom instead which has no ads and never tracks you as well
 ignore private messages offering services
 never enter your seed words in a website of any kind hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface never on a website
 always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving  some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copyandpaste
 avoid clicking on links like that look like links such as httpswwwgooglecomhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvybwrkbme without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to  just because a link is labelled with an https address does not mean it actually sends you to that address  it is trivial for someone to comment a link on reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money

dont trust verify maya parbhoe the next bitcoin president of suriname,8,1jylfrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jylfrz/dont_trust_verify_maya_parbhoe_the_next_bitcoin/,0,2025-04-13 18:48:08,"dear bitcoin community

i was in suriname a few weeks ago with a goal in mind to meet the local btc community and hopefully the presidential candidate maya parbhoe this was my experience

while planning the trip i reached out to maya via her telegram channel to explore the possibility of meeting i was quickly referred to her assistant terance who responded promptly and told me to reach out once i arrived okay fair enough  who am i to demand time from someone running for president at the time i didnt yet know she was pregnant after all im not a famous bitcoin celebrity but i am a prominent figure in curaaos booming bitcoin community and had raised a considerable amount of funds for her campaign

a few days before my arrival i checked in again  same story when i finally landed and reached out while strolling through paramaribo  a city i hadnt visited in over a decade  i couldnt help but notice the drastic economic change the exchange rate had gone from  usd   srd during my last visit to  usd   srd now

terance replied quickly and said he was at a caf with another foreign guest apologies i forgot the persons name and nationality i took the opportunity and met them right away i was warmly welcomed and treated with genuine surinamese hospitality we talked for over an hour about our lives bitcoin journeys and ambitions

over the next few days i met up with terance again and had the pleasure of attending a lecturecourse hosted by the local btc sranan community  held above what im told is mayas business a parcel freight forwarding service from the us to suriname i had drinks and met various local merchants the lecture was given by an american missionary who moved to suriname years ago to teach and decided to stay his dedication and patience were truly inspiring  every educator should take note im extremely grateful for his efforts and for all of btc sranans work toward merchant adoption and bitcoin awareness

now to the topic of this post maya parbhoe

first and foremost im not in the business of destroying reputations im in the business of protecting ours  the true bitcoiners i want there to be a next bitcoin president and suriname certainly deserves one

but red flags were immediately raised when i asked the local bitcoiners about maya  they didnt want to talk about her strange right youd expect someone running for office under the bitcoin banner to be a welcomed topic but perhaps its better  and probably for the best  to separate the local bitcoin community from one persons political ambitions or so i thought

while there i dug deeper into her socalled political campaign and asked a variety of locals  from taxi drivers to businesspeople  about maya not a single one outside of bitcoin circles had heard of her when i brought up her political party the nps the general response was that its a minor insignificant party with no real chance of winning

a quick note on surinamese politics i wont go too deep here as im not intimately familiar with all the parties and political drama of past decades but its important to know that suriname is a parliamentary democracy voters elect a party not a candidate to represent them in parliament the legislative branch generally the winning party chooses the ministerpresident prime minister to lead the government maya is listed as  winkwink on the nps candidate list

additionally i could not find any mention of bitcoin in the official communications from the nps so clearly this isnt an official stance of the party red flag

so her claim that shes running for president of suriname is to put it mildly a massive stretch furthermore this narrative is only pushed to her international audience  through x nostr podcasts and events her local messaging mainly via facebook and local media is entirely different another red flag

now suriname is known for corruption  and for serious threats to individuals who oppose power mayas father was murdered in  reportedly connected to a money laundering and trafficking case where he had served as a whistleblower i confirmed this through archived articles so potential threats to her life should be taken seriously given the history and the current security climate

that said she had already begun claiming that there were threats against her  possibly based on the above but during my stay a new controversy arose she was summoned to testify in a human trafficking case involving the import of people from india to suriname odd she claims this is an attack by authorities aligned with the ruling party that might be true  but who really knows

also she was pregnant not the most ideal timing to begin a presidential campaign  especially your first child red flag

then came a flood of claims about threats political interference and safety concerns  which to be fair is part of politics but again the narratives were drastically different depending on the audience  local vs foreign just compare her facebook posts to what she shares on xnostr red flag

as i was leaving the country the security situation escalated she claimed to have hired  armed security  probably funded by international donations if true id consider that an unfortunate but understandable expense

but things got weirder i wont repeat all the welldocumented incidents  from cryptic social media posts to the bizarre sos xspace at one point she hired a professional security firm which quickly dropped her according to a reliable source the ceo bluntly stated they stopped working with her and warned others against doing so

then she made the outrageous claim that she was being protected by the us secret service or some equivalent this was so absurd it caught local media attention when questioned she said she made the post while medicated to ease pregnancy pains huge red flag

clearly the way she has raised international funds is to say the least misleading and if she truly believes in government transparency maya must start by being transparent herself justify where the donations went proof of funds please

i  and i suspect many of us  let wishful thinking get ahead of us

dont trust verify"
why gold wouldnt work in a multipolar world,50,1jy7c5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jy7c5t/why_gold_wouldnt_work_in_a_multipolar_world/,35,2025-04-13 08:13:09,"its as simple as this settlement in gold requires physical transport which requires navies and armies to secure and while international trade was guaranteed by the dominance of the british navy in the th century and the us navy thereafter without a global hegemon there would be no way to eliminate risk from the settlement procedure making settlement too expensive and too risky to be conducted frequently thus increasing the uncertainty of whether your country was going to get paid 

settlement in gold works fine if you rely on a tokenized system where digital tokens represent real gold in vaults as long as the third party holding the gold and accepting the tokens as redeemable are trusted but that is the problem in a multipolar world there is no universally trusted third party

this is why bitcoin becomes so significant in such a world because it would allow for the real settlement of trade while largely eliminating the risk and dramatically reducing the cost from conducting global trade"

they said it was a scam a ponzi told me i was wasting my time and money every time i brought it up it turned into an argument or a joke at my expense

fast forward to now and they finally get it

over the past couple of months theyve started asking questions not just surfacelevel stuff but real questions about fiat inflation saving and how bitcoin actually works theyve been learning about selfcustody hardware wallets now they even use lightning for small transactions such as buying produce at our local farmers market

its been wild watching them go from complete denial to setting up cold storage and talking about time preference and scarcity has honestly been emotional this thing that used to divide us is now something were exploring together

for anyone out there trying to help their family see what you see know this it takes time a lot of time but once it click it clicks

bitcoin is a game of patience,80,1jxt3fm,https://i.redd.it/z42s9in6chue1.png,33,2025-04-12 17:26:03,"if you try to time the market the odds are stacked against you heres why

if you exclude just the top  bestperforming days each year bitcoin would be down on average every single year yes you read that right and if you exclude the top  biggest pointgain days bitcoin would be down even more each year

this means that the majority of bitcoins gains come in just a handful of days  days you cannot predict if youre out of the market when those moments happen you miss out on the exponential upside

the lesson patience pays timing the market is nearly impossible but time in the market is what builds real wealth just like in the stock market the people who have earned big with btc arent the ones trying to trade every dip and spike theyre the ones who held through volatility ignored the noise and stayed focused on the longterm picture"

i still remember my coworker talking about crypto back in  and me laughing it off as internet funny money after weeks of him showing me charts and explaining the technology i reluctantly threw in  i could barely afford just to shut him up
best decision of my life
that initial investment turned into my obsession i started researching everything i could about blockchain decentralization and investment strategies i set up automatic weekly buys with whatever i could spare  those small consistent purchases added up more than i ever imagined
when the  bull run hit my portfolio exploded i was smart enough to take some profits paid off k in student loans but kept most invested even through the crash and bear market my average buy price kept me well in the green
but the biggest change wasnt just financial  bitcoin completely shifted my mindset i went from someone who couldnt save a penny to someone thinking about longterm wealth building i started learning about traditional investing opened a roth ira and even got serious about my career to increase my income
for anyone on the fence about crypto  im not saying throw your life savings in but the journey of learning and small consistent investing changed everything for me
anyone else have lifechanging experiences with bitcoin

the bitcoin community points out that newcomers often think theyre too late people considering bitcoin for the first time look at the price history and think they missed their chance similarly especially during bitcoins most exciting times people look at the price and think its too expensive

the funny thing is thats been true since before  and a  price i know because i had those same thoughts back then and i expect people to have similar thoughts at  and then at  and then at 

one bitcoin went from buying  big macs in  to over  big macs in  it went from needing  bitcoin to buy a typical house in  to just  in  thats a huge jump but its also an ongoing trend  theres still a lot of room for bitcoin to grow even more in the future

new technologies tend to follow a predictable adoption curve starting with a small group of innovators and early adopters before gaining traction with the broader public as things improve

in  bryant gumbel a host of the popular today show stumbled through trying to understand an email address bryant asked what is internet anyway

his cohost katie couric responded internet is that massive computer network the one thats becoming really big now bryant asked what do you write to it like mail

the next year famous comedian david letterman had bill gates on his late night talk show letterman asked what about this internet thing do you know anything about that bill gates said sure and talked a bit about how it lets people publish information and send email letterman poked fun at gates the entire time 

when gates talked about the ability to listen to a baseball game online letterman jokingly asked have you heard of radio do tape recorders ring a bell gates went on to describe the most basics of social networking by that point letterman was laughing in his face and the crowd laughed along

in those days the internet was an emerging technology not yet mainstream i remember reading business magazines at the time  printed on paper they had articles with titles like is it time for you to put your business online then the entire article would explain all the reasons you shouldnt bother to have a website for your business

in  paul krugman a distinguished professor of economics said

the growth of the internet will slow drastically as the flaw in metcalfes lawwhich states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participantsbecomes apparent most people have nothing to say to each other by  or so it will become clear that the internets impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machines

ok it can be fun to look back at the early days of things and poke fun at the people who didnt understand what was coming 

but its also educational to look at how society initially reacts to new unfamiliar things as they emerge and grow there is always a some amount of fear uncertainty and doubt around new things

in  the internet had about  million users that was about  of the worlds population at the time ten years later  it was a bit over  billion users or about  of the worlds population another ten years  got it to well over  billion users  of world population today the internet has more than  billion users which is about  of the worlds population

the internet is not the only interesting new technology we can look at here are two others that made history



credit cards 

the idea of a small plastic card that lets you charge purchases started in the s before  credit cards were owned by about  million users worldwide that was about  of the worldwide adult population at the time by the end of the s they were used by about  million people or about  of the worlds adult population

in  a local tv news station went into a burger king restaurant in the us the restaurant had just started accepting credit cards the news station asked customers what they thought about using credit cards to buy burger king food 

one customer said i think its pretty bad if you have to use a credit card when you go to a fast food restaurant and then expressed concern that someone would have to call new york to confirm the transaction another customer said i just hope it doesnt slow things down a third customer a gray haired gentleman dressed in a suit and tie said i just cant imagine it working on a daytoday basis

about  million people owned credit cards at the time or about  of adults worldwide  million in the us or about  of adult americans

from there usage steadily increased today credit cards are used by about  billion people about  of adults worldwide  million in the us or about  of adult americans



smartphones

in  andy grove ceo of intel described the idea of a wireless personal communicator in every pocket as a pipe dream driven by greed the first smartphone was released back in  but only got about  users

but in  the iphone came out and the overall market quickly got to  million users worldwide or about  of the worlds population microsofts ceo at the time steve ballmer stated theres no chance that the iphone is going to get any significant market share

by  the overall smartphone market was at  billion users worldwide or about  of world population today were looking at almost  billion users about  of the planet



thats a basic review of several technologies that emerged in the past how does bitcoin compare

it can be difficult to pin down exactly how many people own bitcoin today but specialists at companies like chainalysis study data from bitcoin apps and conduct surveys to count users in the us and worldwide they report that about  million people own bitcoin today thats about  of the worlds population

thats roughly similar to  for credit cards or the late s for the internet or about  for smartphones

most people in the world dont own any bitcoin yet big companies and even governments are just now starting to take it seriously 

we recently passed the stage where steve balmer the ceo of microsoft said theres no chance that the iphone is going to get any significant market share weve just barely reached the stage where david letterman laughed at bill gates and suggested the internet was no more useful than radio and tape recorders were not yet at the stage where a burger king customer looked at the restaurants new credit card readers and said i just cant imagine it working on a daytoday basis

theres a long way to go before bitcoin really catches on

youre not late

for instance salt was used so much as money originally that it is the root for the word salary which comes from salarium meaning payment in salt

banco means bench or table medieval moneylenders sat at benches if a banker failed their bench was broken  banca rotta  bankrupt

credit is latin and means to believe or trust as in you believe someone will pay you back

fiat means let it be done or essentially i declare meaning i declare this has value

lets make a sentence and translate it

fiat money is created using credit roughly translates into i declare this newly made money has value and you believe that it will be paid back eventually

what is rbtc

the rbtc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin it quickly gained momentum in august  when the bitcoin block size debate heightened on the legacy rbitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions

once realized the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship which led tohttparchiveisgaz thousands of redditors being banned from the rbitcoin subreddit a large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as rbitcoinuncensored and rbtc for a rundown on the history of censorship please read a brief and incomplete history of censorship in rbitcoin by john blockehttpsmediumcomjohnblockeabriefandincompletehistoryofcensorshipinrbitcoincafe and rbitcoin censorship revisted by john blockehttpsmediumcomjohnblockerbitcoincensorshiprevisiteddbbdcd as yet another example rbitcoin censored  posts and commentshttpswwwredditcomrnoncensoredbitcoincommentsnfseptemberstatspost just in the month of september  alone this shows the sheer magnitude of censorship that is happening which continues to this day read a synopsis of rbitcoinhttpswwwredditcomrbitcoinmarketscommentsrxwkinformativebtcvsbcharticlesdlvlp to get the full story and a complete understanding of why people are so upsethttpswwwredditcomrkarmacourtcommentsgvqfandnowforsomethingcompletelydifferentthe with rbitcoins censorship further reading can be found herehttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentsvgdmacollectionofevidenceregardingbitcoins and herehttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentscpfteaitsimportanttorememberthepastandshowewpabj with a giant collection of information regarding these topics



why is censorship bad for bitcoin

as demonstrated above censorship has become prevalent in almost all of the major bitcoin communication channelshttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentsmxovwtfnorthkoreascgctriestocontrolbitcoindchwl the impacts of censorship in bitcoinhttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentscxxttheimpactsofcensorship are very real censorship can really hinder a society if it is bad enough because media is such a large part of peoples lives today and it is the source of basically all information if the information is not being given in full or truthfully then the society is left uneducated  censorship is probably the number one way to lower peoples right to freedom of speech by censoring certain topics and specific wordshttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentsvrijpartiallistofwordsthatautomodremovesfrom people in these bitcoin communication channels are literally being brain washed into thinking a certain way molding the reader in a way that they desire this has a lasting impact especially on users who are new to bitcoin censoring in bitcoin is the direct opposite of what the spirit of bitcoin is and should be condemned anytime it occurs also its important to think criticallyhttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentstxjeedwardsnowdentheanswertofakenewsisnot and independentlyhttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentscmnjpsathesubhasbeenunderattackbyvariousbad and have an open mind



why do some groups attempt to discredit rbtc

this subreddit has become a place to discuss everything bitcoinrelated and even other cryptocurrencies at times when the topics are relevant to the overall ecosystem since this subreddit is one of the few places on reddit where users will not be censored for their opinions and people are allowed to speak freely truth is often said here without the fear of reprisal from moderators in the form of bans and censorship because of this freedom people and groups who dont want you to hear the truth with do almost anything they can to try to stop you from speaking the truth and try to manipulate readers here you can see many cited examples of cases where special interest groups have gone out of their way to attack this subreddit and attempt to disrupt and discredit it see the examples herehttpsoldredditcomrbtccommentscmnjpsathesubhasbeenunderattackbyvariousbad



what is the goal of rbtc

this subreddit is a diverse community dedicated to the success of bitcoin rbtc honors the spirit and nature of bitcoin being a place for open and free discussion about bitcoin without the interference of moderators subscribers at anytime can look at and review the public moderator logshttpsmodlogsfyirbtc this subreddit does have ruleshttpswwwredditcomrbtcwikiindexwikirulesforthissubredditalsointhesidebar as mandated by reddit that we must follow plus a couple of rules of our own make sure to read the rbtc wikihttpswwwredditcomrbtcwikiindex for more information and resources about this subreddit which includes information such as the benefits of bitcoin how to get started with bitcoin and more



what is bitcoin

bitcoin is a digital currency also called a virtual currency which can be transacted for a lowcost nearly instantly from anywhere in the world bitcoin also powers the blockchain which is a public immutable and decentralized global ledger unlike traditional currencies such as dollars bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever there is no government company or bank in charge of bitcoin as such it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks with bitcoin you can be your own bank read the bitcoin whitepaper to further understand the schematics of how bitcoin works



what is bitcoin cash

bitcoin cash ticker symbol bch is an updated version of bitcoin which solves the scaling problems that have been plaguing bitcoin core ticker symbol btc for years bitcoin bch is just a continuation of the bitcoin project that allows for bigger blocks which will give way to more growth and adoption you can read more about bitcoin on bitcoincashorghttpsbitcoincashorg or read what is bitcoin cashhttpswwwbitcoincominfowhatisbitcoincash for additional details



how do i buy bitcoin

how do i store my bitcoin securely

after the initial step of buying your first bitcoin you will need a bitcoin wallet to secure your bitcoin knowing which bitcoin wallet to choose is the second most important step in becoming a bitcoin user since you are investing funds into bitcoin choosing the right bitcoin wallet for you is a critical step that shouldnt be taken lightly use this guide to help you choose the right wallet for youhttpswwwbitcoincomgetstartedhowtochoosetherightbitcoinwallet check the sidebar under bitcoin wallets to get started and find a wallet that you can store your bitcoin in



why is my transaction taking so long to process

bitcoin transactions typically confirm in  minutes a confirmation means that the bitcoin transaction has been verified by the network through the process known as mining once a transaction is confirmed it cannot be reversed or double spent transactions are included in blocks

if you have sent out a bitcoin transaction and its delayed chances are the transaction feehttpsbitcoinfeescash you used wasnt enough to outcompete others causing it to be backloggedhttpsjochenhoenickedequeueh the transaction wont confirm until it clears the backlog this typically occurs when using the bitcoin core btc blockchain due to poor central planning

if you are using bitcoin bch you shouldnt encounter these problems as the block limits have been raised to accommodate a massive amount of volume freeing up space and lowering transaction costs



why does my transaction cost so much i thought bitcoin was supposed to be cheap

as described above transaction fees have spiked on the bitcoin core btc blockchain mainly due to a limit on transaction space this has created what is called a fee market which has primarily been a premature artificially induced price increase on transaction fees due to the limited amount of block space available supply vs demand the original plan was for fees to help secure the network when the block reward decreased and eventually stopped but the plan was not to reach that point until some time in the future around the year httpswikibitcoincomwcontrolledsupplyprojectedbitcoinslongterm this original plan was restored with bitcoin bch where fees are typically less than a single penny per transaction



what is the block size limit

the original bitcoin client didnt have a block size cap however was limited to mb due to the bitcoin protocol message size constraint however in july  bitcoins creator satoshi nakamoto introduced a temporary mb limithttpssourceforgenetpbitcoincodetreetrunkmainhdifffcbcedbaa as an antiddos measure the temporary measure from satoshi nakamoto was made clear three months later when satoshi said the block size limit can be increased again by phasing it inhttpsarchiveislyvpselection when its needed when the demand arises when introducing bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list in  satoshi said that scaling to visa levelshttpswwwmailarchivecomcryptographymetzdowdcommsghtml would probably not seem like a big deal



what is the block size debate all about anyways

the block size debate boils down to different sets of users who are trying to come to consensus on the best way to scale bitcoin for growth and success scaling bitcoin has actually been a topic of discussion since bitcoin was first released in  for example you can read how satoshi nakamoto was asked about scaling herehttpswwwmailarchivecomcryptographymetzdowdcommsghtml and how he thought at the time it would be addressed fortunately bitcoin has seen tremendous growth and by the year  scaling bitcoin had became a hot topic for a run down on the history of scaling and how we got to where we are today see the block size limit debate history lesson posthttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentsmxujblocksizelimitdebatehistorylesson



what is a hard fork

a hard fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules which is accepted by nodes that have upgraded to support the new protocol in this case bitcoin diverges from a single blockchain to two separate blockchains a majority chain and a minority chain



what is a soft fork

a soft fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules but the difference is that nodes dont realize the rules have changed and continue to accept blocks created by the newer nodes some argue that soft forks are badhttpsmediumcomoctskywardonconsensusandforkscace because they trick oldunupdated nodes into believing transactions are valid when they may not actually be valid this can also be defined as coercion as explained by vitalik buterinhttpsvitalikcageneralforksandmarketshtml



doesnt it hurt decentralization if we increase the block size

some argue that by lifting the limit on transaction space that the cost of validating transactions on individual nodes will increase to the point where people will not be able to run nodes individually giving way to centralization this is a false dilemma because at this time there is no proven metric to quantify decentralization although it has been shown that the current level of decentralization will remainhttpswwwredditcomrbtccommentsfyvefallacythekeytobitcoinsdecentralizationisa with or without a block size increase its a logical fallacy to believe that decentralization only exists when you have people all over the world running full nodes the reality is that only people with the income to sustain running a full node even at mb will be doing it so whether its mb mb or mb the costs of doing business is negligible for the people who can already do it if the block size limit is removed this will also allow for more users worldwide to use and transact introducing the likelihood of having more individual node operators decentralization is not a metric its a tool or directionhttpstwittercomloppstatus this is a good video describing the direction of how decentralization should lookhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsiqaslrq

additionally the effects of increasing the block capacity beyond mb has been studiedhttpswwwcryptocoinsnewscomcornellstudyrecommendsmbblocksizebitcoin with results showing that up to mb is safe and will not hurt decentralization cornell paper pdfhttpfcifcaaibitcoinpaperscdepdf other papers also show that no block size limit is safe peter rizun pdfhttpswwwbitcoinunlimitedinforesourcesfeemarketpdf lastly through an informal survey among all top bitcoin miners many agreed that a block size increase between mb is acceptablehttparchiveisudqr

 i am sending this message from the year 

ok

  in  and  in 

uh

 today earlies our term for early adapters as well as those rich whose wealth survived the transition live in isolated gated cities called citadels

sure thing

 in my world soon to be your world most governments no longer exist

beg to differ

 as bitcoin transactions are done anonymously and thus most governments can enforce no taxation on their citizens

actually in this world in  bitcoin is anything but anonymous and adoption has been stifled

 why didnt we abandon bitcoin and move to another system well we tried of course we tried to step over to an inflationary cryptocurrency but nobody with an iq above  was willing to step up first and volunteer

tell me what youre advocating without telling me you work for bankers

 the african union had ambitious plans to help its citizens be ready to step over to bitcoin

not really sorry to disappoint

 i am part of an underground network who seek to launch a coordinated attack against the very infrastructure of the internet itself

its been more than clear that a free internet is as much maybe even more of a pain in the ass than bitcoin for those who dislike the freedom of others

 however i have seen where it ends

time traveling post ended where it began with lies

nice to be in  where much is not rosy but at least the deception of earlier times is gradually exposed

bitcoin is moss,14,1jy05hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jy05hf/bitcoin_is_moss/,16,2025-04-13 00:06:10,"bitcoin is moss

body
bitcoin isnt a revolution in the traditional sense it doesnt shout it doesnt demand it doesnt storm the gates

it spreads

like moss

it moves quietly it doesnt need headlines or permission it simply finds surfacesold stone decaying wood forgotten cracks in foundationsand begins to grow slowly persistently irreversibly

fiat systems are the stone
they appear solid institutions currencies central banks but over time they weather they crack their weight becomes their weakness and once those cracks appear bitcoin enters

it doesnt attack the structure it covers it it renders it obsolete not by confrontation but by quiet redundancy its not about destruction its about persistence

you cant uproot mossit has no central stalk
you cant kill it by cuttingit grows from fragments
you cant burn it awayit thrives in the shade and returns with the rain

bitcoin is the same
theres no ceo to arrest
no headquarters to raid
no switch to flip
its a distributed organism a living network of memory and value
every attempt to contain it only spreads its awareness

and like moss it thrives in neglected placeswhere trust has eroded where inflation eats value where systems are collapsing under their own weight

the more centralized control tries to reassert itself the more obvious the need for something else becomes
bitcoin doesnt replace fiat by force it makes it irrelevant
not through revolution but through saturation

you dont notice moss at first
then one day the statue is covered
the wall is green
the monument to the old world is now a part of the forest floor

thats bitcoin

not a war
a reclamation

why min block time is better than min block time,0,1jyhl89,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jyhl89/why_30min_block_time_is_better_than_10min_block/,8,2025-04-13 15:45:30,"if you understand how pow works you know why sn decided that block time is  mins and not  mins when we have too many miners that speed up the bitcoin clock difficulty adjustment slows it down so the nodes can have consensus the slower the block time the less likely the event that  valid blocks are found at the same time where we have to measure the chain tip weight to decide the winning chain tip the losing chain tip wastes a lot of energy

the payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received  when there are multiple doublespent versions of the same transaction one and only one will become valid the receiver of a payment must wait an hour or so before believing that its valid the network will resolve any possible doublespend races by then  sn 

based on the sns quote above we should have decided that the block time is  hour however that might be too slow for some applications so  mins seem better

i have proposed a slower version of bitcoin its whitepaper can be found here httpswwwredditcomriceevcoinsdxsdjbbev

itll start with tx fees gng through the roof as banks govts and big businesses start settling onchain
all normies will have to deposit their btc in the banks as all small utxo  ie  of populations stash will become dust utxo and self custody on l will become a luxury only top  could afford 

all normies now transact on ls where banks provide their ious initially banks will happily provide proof of reserves to lure you in and make you trust them but eventually theyll stop doing so as they start inflating the ious
at one point the ious floating around will be too much and ppl will start questioning the banks but even then what could one do since you cant self custody on l due to high tx fees

even if ppl start withdrawing from banks somehow the banks will stop  withdrawals pretty quickly and central banks  govts instead of taking action on the banks for inflating the ious will simply make fractional reserve legal for btc too
so now for each  btc banks would be allowed to issue  btc ious on l that too legally which they would already be doing for a long time and even after getting caught it will just become a legal practice instead

welcome back to gold  system where fiat was the l for gold and we all know how that turned out

but somehow ppl continue to believe therell be no bailouts censorship draconian level surveillance and taxation on l 

only real solution is some pp cash with low fee l txs with relatively quick tx confirmations 

bch works great as a pp ecash system on l but its limited supply and trending to zero block subsidy is a major risk as it puts a time limit on the adoption picking up 
if the adoption  tx volume doesnt pick before the block subsidy runs out bch will be dead too 

i think some predetermined linear inflation is a good thing in the long term as it replaces lost coins and more importantly prevents hoarding mentality 
it also doesnt put a hard time limit on the adoption which will clearly take a long time given how brainwashed general public is about btc "
saylor was wrong nd best is here,0,1jxwxiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jxwxiq/saylor_was_wrong_2nd_best_is_here/,48,2025-04-12 20:50:54,"historically among the metallic money group silver is the nd best compared to gold some people simply prefer silvers color

among the blockchain money group the nd best is really similar to bitcoin except it has slower block time  mins and lower supply cap  million coins all other parameters remain the same as bitcoin

since pow consumes a lot of energy but most people only use it as store of value it is more logical to slow the block time down to  mins vs bitcoins  mins you dont put your gold into storage and immediately take your gold out  mins later even when you charge your electric cars it will take at least  mins to get any meaningful energy

the lower supply cap is obviously to minimalize the inflation caused by this inevitable hard fork

the whitepaper of this hard fork was shared to rbtc yesterday i also shared it to rbitcoin today as i needed time to find the right words to share it there where a lot of bitcoin maxis are still the moderators there did not allow this to be posted

please dont get me wrong i love bitcoin and bitcoin is still the best however this nd best is inevitable since careless people are everywhere and most lost coins cannot be easily recovered as the number of lost coins rises at some point we might not have enough coins to address the salability across scales

lastly i want to note that this is still just a whitepaper written by my friend frost aiken a developer who prefers to remain pseudonymous i am having trouble contacting frost but will try again later when and how this whitepaper can become an actual hard fork will depend on many factors and only time will tell god bless and a good weekend yall

so back in june last year i began buying bitcoin in portions gradually building up to a total of  btc by the end of novemberwhen the price was around  i held on trusting my read of the global situation and when bitcoin hit  i sold everything

this was actually my first real experience with this kind of investmentand it paid off big time
but for me it wasnt just about being patient it was about staying aware and reading between the lines of whats happening in the world

has anyone else been through something similar do you think political analysis is always this powerful in timing big market moves

not trusting themselves to understand it they ignore it believe what existing financial authorities tell them about it often a rather biased story since  and rather play the lottery stonks ponzi coins  incl btc these days

its a shame it really seems people need a shock or a hugely visible like nation level example of how peer to peer cash adoption can succeed

i dont think any form of speculation is the killer app for bringing bitcoin awareness to the masses

its mildly encouraging that a lot of people now recognize the threat of inflation and the difficulty of saving for old age and some of them may reexamine what is wrong with our financial systems and whether its a problem inherent in the facile money printing of fiat debt money"

this paper outlines iceevcoin conceived as an experimental minimalist variant of the bitcoin protocol it stems from a deep respect for bitcoins core principles proofofwork utxo model but explores the potential impact of just two specific parameter changes

  maximum supply fixed at  million coins exploring extreme scarcity

  target block interval set to  minutes exploring potential effects on network energy profile and niche settlement times like ev charging

the full rationale and technical specification details are in the whitepaper linked below the intention is strict adherence to bitcoins design in all other functional aspects

whitepaper is here httpswwwredditcomriceevcoinsdimwjtligi

current status  call for collaboration

to be fully transparent the source code implementing these changes is not yet developed frost aiken conceptualized the variant and authored the paper but due to resource constraints implementation hasnt begun

this whitepaper is being shared specifically to gauge interest within communities familiar with bitcoin forksvariants and to seek potential c developers knowledgeable about the bitcoin core codebase who might find this specific exploration intriguing and be interested in collaborating on its implementation code testnet etc

acknowledged tradeoffs
the minute block time is a major design choice with a significant impact on transaction speed making it unsuitable for many applications this is understood and is part of the specific tradeoff being explored as detailed in the paper

project ethos
there is no premine ico or founders reward envisioned the intent is a fair launch mirroring bitcoins principles should the project proceed to implementation

contact
developers interested in discussing the technical aspects further or potentially collaborating can reach out to me bubblyice via reddit pm initially we welcome constructive technical feedback and discussion on the merits and challenges of this proposed variant"

voxcash  a collection of integrated bitcoin cash mini apps  fundmecash campaign ,10,1jtnkck,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1jtnkck/voxcash_a_collection_of_integrated_bitcoin_cash/,0,2025-04-07 10:09:12,"yesterday i started a fundme for a collection of small bch web apps in an integrated wallet collectively the hope is if a number of safe ideas are integrated into a wallet and handed to a novice user they might have more bitcoin cash the next time you meet up these apps could live in a walled garden and eventually graduate out to other wallets

having several small apps integrated into one can often be more than the sum of the parts theres a lot of things that can be done by utilizing small functions together that cant be done with isolated apps

these are the mini apps

 chats
 an index database
 subscriptions
 fungible token mining
 limit order dexes
 auctions
 time locks re hodl  last will
 yields fbch  badgers
 irrevocable trusts reunspentcash
 integrated accounting

the end product will be deployed in a unified platform with integrated web wallet this app is going to be like a refresh of member or memo with cashtokens but without the need for a custom indexer or specialized backend server theres going to be less emphasis on the social media aspect and more focus on basic economic access and utility

all of the miniapps listed below will be small onchain contracts some ideas are completely new and some are updated versions of earlier projects it may seem like a lot of work but the smaller the contract the easier things are to build audit and debug 

this app will be funded through a fundmecash campaign  which and expires in julyhttpsfundmecash

this work is expected take about a year to build out most of the contracts are near completion and through testing there is a budget of about  bch for audits 

there are people in the world who want to take everyones bitcoin cash to get rid of it as a currency these people really do not it like when people save bchespecially with defi contracts theres been threats harassment and ultimatums with this work including by some people claiming to further the original bitcoin pp project

please consider utilizing the pseudonymous properties of bitcoin cash if making a donation to avoid a dm from those folks 

for developers and bot programmers most of these utilities will also ship as stateless libauth template mixin functions for any web wallet meaning app developers can adopt a single component or follow along with their idea on the same template and mainnetjs the core functionality will also be an open software software library and command line utility if someone wants to automate or integrate some component into their project or workflow

who am i i develop software under the username githubgitlab account qx i was a founding developer on mainnetjs mainnet was originally suppose to have a number of verbshttpswebarchiveorgwebhttpsmainnetcash to closely integrate with bch defi in  in december  i raised  bch to further develop unspentapp which was about six miniapp contracts without a wallet or tokens in  unspent was reduced into just perpetuities as unspentcash in  i raised  bch to build futurebitcoincash a recursive timelocking market using fungible cashtoken series 

contact im available on reddit as uqx and telegram as aqxusername 


  we need to have a chat 

right now the places where the original idea of bitcoin can be freely discussed are in a fairly precarious state 

one of the main platforms has recently announced a ban on the use of any cryptocurrency except their preferred currencies and its based in a jurisdiction that is hostile to free thought and free speech 

another older platform is a now a publicly traded company with a bot problem and being based in the united states it too is now in a jurisdiction increasingly hostile to free speech and thought 

and finally there is the platform where bot engagement trolled a dull eccentric individual into bidding for the platform before he realized much of the engagement he was basing his decision on was driven by trolls and bots it no longer seems like an app where many smart folks disseminate ideas 

in short we need a public group chat thats not vicariously controlled by a russian actor and where the ability to talk about and use the real bitcoin can never be rugged so were going to have a public group chat onchainhttpsbitcoincashresearchorgtfuturechanamessageboardcontract utilizing nft commitments as the storage medium messages will cost about  sats per byte and old messages will get burned up to feed a future saving economy 

with this chan any message can be censored by anyone for  sats per byte and it will be possible to see which messages got burned early for those interested different channels for different topics will be supported 

this app is a marketplace of ideas

  a reliable keyvalue database

similar to a group chat just storing a little bit of data announcing the existence of a defi contract can be a significant pain point for many new small dapp projects 

currently many dapps have built custom crawlers to index data stored onchain using what are called opreturn messages many apps are relying on public instances of chaingraphhttpschaingraphcash which is software that is expensive and nontrivial to run there are also performance and scaling issues that arise with these indexers which often hampers the user experience in dapps

so the second miniapp will be a highly distributed keyvalue database small indexhttpsbitcoincashresearchorgtasmallkeyvalueindexcontract is a contract that will be able to store references and records to chat groups auctions trade offers and new longrunning contracts data can be read from the highly reliable and scalable spv index fulcrum electrumx or rostrum reading the records for a key will be as reliable as looking up the token balance of an address

records will be limited to bytes or the current nft commitment length and cost  sat per block to store miners will collect storage fees to clean up old data 

this app is a market for data storage

  subscriptions

regardless of whether the fundme campaign is successful looking forward it will be better for the ecosystem to have a more predictable funding model available 

so there will be an ugly subscribe button in the app that does nothing but hide the button for people that subscribed 

the subscription contracthttpsbitcoincashresearchorgtunspentphivtimelockingtokenawarecontractssubscriptionssharevestingrevocabletokenannuities will allow anyone to create subscriptions paid out in any fungible token users will be able to cancel or withdraw their subscription balance early with an nft baton held in their wallet 

the subscriptions will be announced using the keyvalue small database from the previous step miners or any enterprising party will be able to collect a few sats for executing the regular installments 

easily creating subscriptions for content creators app developers podcasters and mods will be available in the miniapp the app should enable predictable baseline revenue for many voices and creators across the bitcoin cash ecosystem

there will be no tiers or rentseeking features for this specific project although other people may build apps utilizing gated subscription features theres too much to do and too little time to try to milk people over sats so for this app the subscription will only ever just hide an ugly subscribe button

this app will create a market mechanism for future support

  mining

novice users want to mine so were going to let them mine fungible tokens that can then be traded for sats 

bitcoin cash previously had a minable slp token called mistcoinwebarchiveorgwebhttpsmistcoinorg which was a project that saw immediate spontaneous adoption and a healthy secondary market additionally an early iteration of unspent phi had a minable contract paying sats which saw immediate uptake 

so were going to have a multithreaded contract paying out tokens according to some halflife with an adjustable difficulty target stored in mutable nft commitmentbecause we effing can 

eventually if it gets big enough the average of the difficulty targets across the mining threads can be utilized as a proxy for a highly decentralized price oraclehttpsbitcoincashresearchorgtresearchblockdifficultyasapriceoracle that price oracle can then be utilized by other contracts to drive more stable coin markets 

this app is a market to trade energy for tokens

  a dex fit for a stablecoin

users want stability and the detractors of the idea of bitcoin often cite volatility relative to fiat as the first major risk to deter adoption among novice users 

while automated market algorithms can provide liquidity across a very robust price range we need markets to trade stable assets with a fair amount of depth at very specific prices as well 

we need limit order markets by storing limit order data in the commitment of an nft it will be possible for anyone to list tokens for sale on a contract and then have the contract allowhttpsbitcoincashresearchorgtcatdexatokencategoryauthorizeddecentralizedexchange anyone to trade at the predefined order price 

this app is similar to open ask limit orders on memo or tapswap but it will allow partial orders and be bidirectional 

someone could fund a contract with sats to buy a token at a predefined price andor sell the same token at a higher price from using the same contract 

many users will be able to list their spreads for a particular token and bots will be able to arbitrage across many contracts and dexes catdex has no commissions

this is a market for a stable coin

  dutch auctions for token price discovery 

if someone sells a bunch of tokens often the only record or price history is the initial token sale without active and liquid markets there is no data to dissuade the investor that theyre actually just throwing their money away on collectibles without liquid markets collectibles can absorb liquidity attention and mindshare often without much merit or underlying utility to give value back to the user 

on other chains the value of nft sets can eventually be estimated by records of onchain english auctions but auctions could also be very efficiently held on bitcoin cash for any type of token by using the age of the unspent output in a dutch auctionhttpsbitcoincashresearchorgtunspentphivtimelockingtokenawarecontracts 

the auction app will allow anyone to announce a dutch auction and fund their contract with any number of fungible tokens or nfts to be disposed of on their behalf anyone will be able to clearly see the current price given the starting price and the age of the unspent output anyone will be able to purchase the tokens in a transaction paying the consignor the current ask bots and traders will be able to arbitrage or trade tokens at auction with the same token listed as a limit order or amm threads 

users may cancel their lots by buying back their own tokens bidders can be fairly assured that lots will sell to someone and the process of price discovery can be a reference to speculators of collectibles auctions will have no listing commissions or buyers premiumsonly fees paid to miners 

this is a market to liquidate tokens

    absolute and relative time locks 

hodlstyle and rolling time locks have been around for ten years 

weve had these apps in the electrum cash as plugins users can lock coins until a certain time or have their coins pay out to another party if not touched for some period of time 

these ideas will be refreshedhttpsbitcoincashresearchorgtunspentphivtimelockingtokenawarecontractsabsolutetimelockbiphodlstylevaultwithcashtokensupport to handle locking cashtokens as well 

both of the contracts can be made to autocomplete via anyonecanspend transactions by announcing a record of the lock using the small keystore database  above 

these contracts market the idea of locking coins

    users want reliable yields

we have two dapps on bitcoin cash paying a solid yield without risking user capital on highlymanipulated markets  

users can stake coins for badgershttpsbadgerscash or they can take coupons for staking futureshttpsfuturebitcoincashcoupons in both cases users arent risking the loss of their capital to fiat manipulation or wild tokenomics 

both of these timelocked staking apps are perfect for a walled garden theyll both have integrated support without any need to connect a wallet to an external integration

this are yield bearing markets to lock coins

  last irrevocable trust 

an ultrapredictable stream of revenue is a wonderful thing 

for almost three years now the number of contracts streaming monthly payments to users has been growing and theyll continue to grow with the fourth more streamlined version of the contract  

unspentcashhttpsunspentcash perpetuities will benefit greatly from direct wallet integration as well as better historical tabulations now available from mainnetjs 

the next iteration will accommodate fees and payouts running below the current dust limit and propagation fee threshold

onchain irrevocable trusts are a market in time for users of bitcoin cash that know what they have and what its worth

 bonus accounting

blockchains are great at keeping a kind of accounting ledger given a standard set of contracts its fairly feasible to map out what happened to user funds in a clear and deterministic way without storing notes or account nicknames on the blockchain 

there is a rich set of tooling for plain text accounting that can let users manage and plan their income and expenditures in a predictable way 

if we give people tools to make earn and save money it then makes sense to let them plan how to spend it when all the mini apps are done itd be nice to have some limited accounting and be able to export the data upstream

sasros cipher and its encryption algorithms sasrcs  sasrbs  seeking cryptographic review,0,1jwmu1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jwmu1r/sasros_cipher_and_its_encryption_algorithms/,4,2025-04-11 05:43:51," update

after helpful feedback it is clear that the sasros cipher along with the sasrcs and sasrbs encryption algorithms contains fundamental cryptographic weaknesses and should not be used to secure any sensitive data under any circumstances these algorithms along with the associated tools are not suitable for realworld security applications and are intended solely for experimental and educational purposes



im an independent developer with a longstanding interest in cryptographic systems and secure algorithm design over the past year ive been working on a symmetric keybased random substitution cipher and a pair of encryption algorithms built on it

this effort has led to the creation of the sasros cipher random object substitution and two encryption algorithms that build on it

 sasrcs random character substitution 
 sasrbs random binary substitution 

these algorithms implementation documentation and related tools are available as a part of the free  opensource sasroset project credits will be given on the project websites credits page

 

 note

this post is not intended to market or promote a product my goal is to

 share the design with the cryptographic community
 invite review and critique of the theoretical model
 explore potential weaknesses and attack surfaces
 learn from experts and enthusiasts alike

i fully understand that substitutionbased systems are often considered weak or outdated however i believe the dynamic randomized nature of this cipher and its encryption algorithms offers a fresh perspective on how substitution can be applied even if not practical for production it may prove valuable as a hybrid component  or at the very least serve as an educational tool for those exploring cryptographic design

in this post and the official documentation ive shared all current findings conclusions and assumptions these are subject to change as research progresses i also acknowledge that some conclusions may be inaccurate or incomplete which is why further analysis and external input are essential the algorithms remain open to improvement and contributions from the community are not only welcome  theyre genuinely appreciated and will be credited

if you find any part of the official documentation unclear or feel that it lacks important details please dont hesitate to let me know  ill do my best to address it as quickly as possible

 

 overview of sasros cipher

sasros saaiq abdulla saeeds random object substitution is a randomized keydriven substitution cipher it performs objectlevel substitution by using two keys  a dynamic key a permutation of objects and a static key a permutation of indexes which together represents a substitution table unlike traditional substitution ciphers it introduces randomized transformations determined by keys the cipher is  formatagnostic an object can be a character bit frequency etc

dynamic key  object array a randomly shuffled set of objects  example for the characters abcdef a dynamic key permutation can be  c e a d f b 

static key  index array a randomly shuffled set of indexes  to n example        

these two types of keys with sasros methods form a bijective mapping hence a substitution table

there are two methods to perform the ros cipher which are inverses of each other therefore if one method is used for encryption the other can be used for decryption and vice versa below is a quick demonstration for sasros method  m

    dynamic key  j i d a h c g f e b 
    static key             
    data b
     locate the index of b in dynamic key  
     retrieve the integer in the  index of the static key  
     identify the character in the  index of dynamic key  a
     substitute b to a
    output a

the effective key space for the sasros cipher is l factorial of the key length representing all possible permutations of a set of l distinct objects  essentially all possible substitution tables  
this large key space is what provides the foundation for the ciphers resistance to bruteforce attacks especially when used with sufficiently large key lengths

refer to the official documentation for more details including methods laws attacking

 

 overview of sasrcsrbs encryption algorithms

the sasrcs random character substitution and sasrbs random binary substitution algorithms are built around the sasros cipher but introduce several additional layers of transformation to enhance security and usability

each algorithm is tailored to a specific data type

 sasrcs is optimized for textlevel encryption
 sasrbs is optimized for binarylevel encryption

unlike the core sasros cipher  which uses a single dynamic key and static key pair  these algorithms employ

 a single dynamic key
 multiple static keys enabling the generation of multiple substitution tables

this approach helps mitigate frequency analysis and increases overall variability

both algorithms also include two key steps

 obfuscation extra data objects are inserted into the original data based on a fixed nm ratio that is for every n data objects add m random objects objects drawn from the dynamic key
 randomized shuffling the entire data set undergoes a deterministic shuffle using all static keys which act as sources of random numbers used for swapping operations while shuffling

 

 key length  key space

these algorithms support variable key lengths of up to approximately  objects

 for a key length l the effective key space is l l factorial representing all permutations of a key of that length
 this means the theoretical maximum key space currently reaches up to   an astronomically large number

its worth noting that the practical entropy and effective strength of the key space may be affected by structural patterns or simplifications in implementation until further empirical research is completed the full factorial key space is assumed as the theoretical upper bound

 

 how to use the algorithms in practice

im asking this because assuming that its true would for example using a custom signal client that additionally encrypts with a derived key from a passphrase or something that was privately communicated improve security  since you dont have to trust signal servers alone on initial contact"
clubcards for the webpki smaller certificate revocation tests in theory and practice,12,1jv572r,https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/610,4,2025-04-09 08:00:45,"to implement public key infrastructure for protocols such as tls parties need to check not only that certificates are properly signed but also that they havent been revoked due to eg key compromise

revocation was originally implemented using certificate revocation lists but those are impractically large  then there is ocsp but this has performance and privacy issues  ocsp stapling can mitigate the privacy issues in tls but is somewhat brittle and often buggy  ocsp services only work for when the parties are online thats the o at or near the time of connection so they are suitable for tls but not other applications such as connected cars

since  researchers including me have been working on a solution called crlite which is basically to compress crls in a way that takes the unique properties of the revocation problem into account  but until now crlite hasnt been quite good enough to reach broad deployment  it was available under a feature flag in firefox but even with compression the crls were too large

at real world crypto  john schanck announced that he has implemented a crlite variant to be rolled out to firefox which is currently enabled by default in desktop firefox nightly  the new system uses a full compressed crl every  days currently  mb plus small updates every  hours currently  kb to implement  of the certificate revocation checks ondevice thus avoiding those ocsp queries  there is still some room for improvement in these sizes both from better compression in firefox eg compression of the metadata using previous metadata as a hint and better practices from cas

what should the server do in a tls  handshake if it doesnt recognise the early data psk,10,1jmm147,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jmm147/what_should_the_server_do_in_a_tls_13_handshake/,4,2025-03-29 08:15:01,"i have a rtt handshake as follows

clients perspective

first flight

the client pings off client hello then uses the early keys to encrypt early data and end of early data application record the encrypted records are all wrapped and look like application records

second flight

the client receives server hello and finds out that the presharedkey wasnt recognised by the server so it uses the serversupplied diffie hellman keys to generate and encrypt the client handshake finished record also wrapped

from the server perspective

the server receives a client hello message and responds with a server hello not including the preshared key extension the server then receives some number of records it cant decrypt followed by a client handshake finished record that it can decrypt

what is the server meant to do here is it meant to attempt decryption of these wrapped application records using the handshake keys and then blindly discard anything it fails to decrypt once the server receives handshake finished encrypted with the right keys it can continue

or is the server meant to send an alert about records it cant decrypt"
asymmetric data encryption  is reversing the role of keys interesting or valuable,0,1jmteev,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jmteev/asymmetric_data_encryption_is_reversing_the_role/,34,2025-03-29 13:55:21,"im currently testing a new encryption algorithm that reverses the traditional concepts of asymmetric keys like rsaecc

for context current asymmetric algorithms rsaecc are primarily used for symmetric key exchange or digital signatures like this

 public key encryptonly cannot decrypt or derive private key
 private key decrypts messages easily derives the public key

due to inherent size limitations rsaecc usually encrypt symmetric keys for aes or similar that are then used for encrypting the actual data

my algorithm reverses the roles of the key pair supporting asymmetric roles directly on arbitrarysize data

 author key symmetric in naturecan encrypt and decrypt data
 reader key derived from the producer key can only decrypt with no feasible way to reconstruct the producer key

this design inherently supports data asymmetry at scaleno secondary tricks or tools needed

i see these as potential use cases but maybe this sub community sees others

potential practical use cases

 software licensingdistribution control
 secure media streaming and broadcast
 realtime secure communications
 secure messaging apps
 drm and confidential document protection
 possibly coldstorage or largescale secure archives

is there any encryption algorithm that uses hashing,0,1jkqsgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jkqsgi/is_there_any_encryption_algorithm_that_uses/,42,2025-03-26 19:04:14,"after looking at all major encryption algorithms ive realized they all are somewhat complex given that the only thing they have to do is take a key and use it to mix all the information beside authentication and efficiency

ive thought of a simple system that would use pure hashing and xoring to encrypt the data just an example for the question of the title

 generate an initial hash with the password
 divide the data to encrypt into n blocks
 hash the initial hash recursively until you have n hashes of sizeblock
 now we take each hash block and each data block and xor them together
 when done put it all together and thats the ciphered output

to decrypt its more of the same

ive not seen found any algorithms that do this or that explain why this is not secure using something like shake to generate hash blocks of kb the efficiency is similar to other algos like aes

i dont see a potential weakness because of the xors since each block has its own limited entropy based on the password which must have high entropy to begin with otherwise its as insecure as other algos

edit

one reason your construction is not secure is that if someone ever recovers a plaintextciphertext pair they can recover that hash block and then iterate it themselves and recover the rest of the key stream

i think this shall not a major brick wall for this scheme but it may be a workaround for this

to mitigate this insert a one block of random data inside our input data this is the random header this works as a salt and as a key recovery problem solver at the same time this way no one can predict it because its data that exists nowhere else but this is useless if we still use a cascade of recursive hashes so

we can mitigate it doing this for each hash block xor it with the result of the last cipher block the first will be xored with the random header it is already xored with the random header

tell me if this makes sense"
what do you think of my protocol design,0,1jjlye4,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1jjlye4/what_do_you_think_of_my_protocol_design/,7,2025-03-25 10:24:29,"this post mentions cryptocurrency but is about the underlying design to secure these keys not about the currency itself it could be applied to any secrets

im a developer working in cryptocurrency space i came across an nfcbased wallet burnerhttpsburnerpro and thought it would be fun to make a similar concept for my business cards my version will only connect to the testnet with worthless assets so it doesnt actually matter but i still want to make it as secure as possible given the constraints the ic they used arxhttpsarxorg is  a pop and supports ondevice secpk signing whereas my version will use cheap ntag nfc stickers

all crypto operations happen in userspace in the browser frontend this is obviously insecure and not suitable for real assets but this is just for fun and an exercise in doing the best possible with the constraints of the hardware while i work with crypto pretty frequently its generally at a higher level so im curious if there are any huge holes in my concept

goals

   assuming i retain all information written to the tags i shouldnt be able to access the wallet private key secpk

   assuming the backend database is compromised the wallet private keys must not be compromised

   assuming the backend api is compromised or mitmd the wallet private keys must not be compromised

   physical access to the nfc tag alone should not be sufficient to access the wallet private key

   the wallet private key should be protected by a userconfigurable pin code not hardcoded and changable

nongoals

   compromises to the users browser is outofscope this includes malicious extensions keyloggers etc

   compromises to the frontend application is outofscope for example inserting malicious code that sends the private key to a rd party after clientside decryption in the same way if signals app was compromised its game over regardless of the encryption this could be mitigated technically by hosting the frontend html on ipfs which is immutable

   compromises of the underlying crypto libraries

   sidechannel or other attacks during wallet key generation

each nfc tag contains a url to my site like httpwalletmecomsecretpayload

the hash portion of a url is never sent to servers its only accessible on the client side the secret payload contains several pieces of data to bootstrap the wallet

  byte random seed  kek seed
  byte ed private key  tag signer
  byte random salt  pin salt

the backend api is preconfigured with the corresponding ed public key for each wallet id

when the nfc tag is read it opens the url to the application which reads the payload and wallet id from the url

fetch metadata

using the id from the url the application makes an unauthenticated request to fetch wallet metadata this returns a status key indicating whether the wallet has been set up

firsttime setup

if the wallet hasnt been set up yet the application starts the setup

 user provides a  digit numeric pin
 the pin is hashed with scrypt using the pin salt to derive a  byte basekey
 an aesgcm kek is derived with pbkdf from the basekey using the kek seed as the salt
   im not sure if this step is superflous  the kek seed could also be used in step  instead of a dedicated pin salt and the scrypt output used directly as the aes key
 a secpkk wallet key key is randomly generated
 the wallet key is encrypted with the kek
 a payload is constructed with the wallet id and encrypted wallet key
 the payload is signed by the tag signer to create the tag signature
 the payload is signed by the wallet key to create the wallet signature
 the payload is sent to the api along with the tag signature and wallet signature
 the api verifies the tag signature using the preconfigured ed public key for the wallet id
   this step ensures the user is in possession of the card to set up the wallet
 the api verifies the wallet signature and recovers the wallet public key and address
 the api stores the encrypted wallet key wallet public key and wallet address

on subsequent access

the metadata indicates the wallet has been set up

the application uses the tag signer to construct a signed request to fetch encrypted wallet key material this returns the encrypted private key wallet public key and address

 the user provides their  digit pin
 the pin is hashed and kek derived the same as during setup
 the encrypted private key is decrypted with the kek
 the wallet public key is derived from the decrypted private key and compared with the known public key if different pin is incorrect
 the wallet is now unlocked

changing pin

once the wallet has been unlocked the user can also change the pin

 the new pin is provided
 a new kek is derived using the same hardcoded salt and seed
 the private key is reencrypted using the new kek
 a payload is constructed with the wallet id and new encrypted private key
 the payload is signed by the tag signer to create the tag signature
 the payload is signed by the wallet key to create the wallet signature
 the payload is sent to the api along with the tag signature and wallet signature
 the api verifies the tag signature using the preconfigured ed public key for the wallet id
 the api verifies the wallet signature and recovers the wallet public key and address
 the wallet public key is compared to the known public key from setup
   this step is to verify that the wallet has been unlocked before changing pin
 the api updates the encrypted wallet key

let me know what you think"

rather than letting all that code go to waste i turned it into a python toolkit with a web interface to make these techniques more accessible this project allows you to experiment with vss schemes easily if youre interested in imagebased cryptography or want to contribute new schemes feel free to check out the github repo httpsgithubcomcodurivisualcryptohttpsgithubcomcodurivisualcrypto

if youve never heard of vss its a technique where instead of using a key to encrypt an image the image is divided into two or more shares individually these shares reveal no information about the original image the secret but when combined they reconstruct it

ive also written an introduction to vss in the tools documentation if youre curious you can check it out here httpscodurigithubiovisualcryptopagesintroductionvsshttpscodurigithubiovisualcryptopagesintroductionvss

this project is still in its early stages and id love to collaborate with anyone interested in expanding vss schemes optimizing performance or improving the ui whether youd like to contribute code share ideas or test the tool any help is greatly appreciated"

ive been to a few cyber conferences of recent and all the talk is primarily  almost exclusively  about pqc

my understanding is that qc will require s of qubits some say at min k other same much more before rsa is broken  however it seems were only in the few to s of qubits right now

then theres the topological materials for qc and that seems like it could accelerate thingsif the hype is true

in contrast i hear no discussions anywhere about the threat of ai cryptanalysis  its my opinion that aic is here now and is more likely a serious threat than qc is   further theres likely to be a huge benefit for ai using qc when qc stabilizes and ai can leverage it

so am i just imagining that ai is a threat  

what are current opinions from folks in this community"

i am a university student currently conducting research to simplify constraints written in the circom language my goal is to reduce the number of constraints generated during circuit compilation thereby increasing the efficiency of the system

i am familiar with writing circom circuits and using snarkjs but ive noticed that there are very few related studies most of the existing research focuses on underconstrained issues and associated security risks

as this is a university project i am not aiming for overly complex optimizations however i am interested in achieving even small optimizations where possible

i would like to ask if anyone could suggest some reference materials i plan to follow the constraint simplification flags provided by circom specifically o and o but i havent found any relevant research papers

any suggestions would be greatly appreciated thank you all"

i would like to get your thoughts about what encourages trust in security implementations when it some to closesource projects

while there are several bugfixes in the pp filetransfer project the codebase is largely the same both projects are sourcecodeavailable because they are webapps its important to note that while the chat project is presented as unminified code file is presented as minified and obfuscated code as closesourced as i can make it claiming the codebase is largely the same becomes more meaninglessunverifyable after this process"
how much of coding theory needs to be learnt for understanding postquantum algorithms like mceliece etc based on codes,10,1it2wz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1it2wz0/how_much_of_coding_theory_needs_to_be_learnt_for/,2,2025-02-19 05:02:08,"i dont know coding theory at all  not even hamming codes 

i know prequantum asymmetric systems reasonably well  i also understand abstract algebra reasonably well

i was trying to look up coding theory  it seems like a separate subject by itself is everything in the whole of coding theory relevant for pqc coding systems

is understanding the basics enough  if yes what would constitute basics in a typical book on coding theory i need to look for the right book also

edit for eg to understand prequantum elliptic curve cryptography i dont need to know deep algebraic geometry  just the basics are enough  i dont need to know affine varieties isogenies riemannroch divisors weil conjectures etc as long as i am not planning to design something new based on ecs just understanding basics of ec over finite fields additiondoubling of points additive group algebraic closures etc is enough

im testing output of an encryption algorithm and would like to know if a test collection of sts results of a very high quantity will be meaningful

my test plan that im running right now

 creation of  cleartext samples across  groups
    repetitivepatterns
       these are things like repeating bytes repeating tuple and triples repeating short ordered sequences and so on
       the patterns are of increasing sizes from around  bytes to just over mb
    lowentropy
       these are cleartext samples that have only a few available bytes in total to distribute
       some samples are just random orders and others are cases where the few bytes are separated by large runs of another like annnnnnnbnnncnnnnnnnnbnnnnnnc
    naturallanguage
       these are randomly constructed english language sentences and paragraphs
       of varying lengths varying sentences per paragraph and varying quantity of paragraphs
    randomdata
       varying lengths of random bytes from a csrng
    precompressed
       using the same construction from naturallanguage brotli compress the data and use that as cleartext samples
       also of varying lengths
    binaryexe
       enumerate files from the local file system for dllexe files between k and mb
       currently produces  files on my host from cwindowssystem and subfolders
    structured
       enumerate xmlhtmljsonrtfcsv files between k and mb
       currently produces  files on my host from cprogram files and subfolders
 for each cleartext encrypt and append the output without padding to a file 
 run ent for the file as well as sts sts params are  million bits length and  streams enabling all tests takes about  mins per file 
 record the results in a db

am i misinterpreting the value of sts for analyzing encrypted data  
will i gain any useful insights by this plan

ive run it for about  hours so far and have done over  million encrypts and over  sts executions  
completion will be just over  runs and near  million encrypts

for any that are curious i created a sandbox that uses the same encryption here  httpsbllnbitcomhttpsbllnbitcom

 open source  bitcoin code is fully auditable  you can read and contribute to the source codehttpsgithubcombitcoinbitcoin yourself
 accountable  the public ledger is transparent all transactions are seen by everyonehttpsblockstreaminfo
 decentralized  bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such cant be shut down similar to how bittorrenthttpsenwikipediaorgwikibittorrent works  you can even run a node on a raspberry pihttpsgetumbrelcom  
 censorship resistant  no one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor alter or block transactions that they disagree with see operation chokepointhttpsenwikipediaorgwikioperationchokepoint
 push system  there are no chargebackshttpsgendalmelessonsfrombitcoinpushversuspull in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them
 borderless  no country can stop it from going inout even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is globally distributedhttpsbitnodesionodeslivemap
 trustless  bitcoin solved the byzantines generals problemhttpsenwikipediaorgwikibyzantinefaulttolerance which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work
 pseudonymous  no need to expose personal informationhttpsbuybitcoinworldwidecomanonymity when purchasing with cash or transacting 
 secure  blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured using hashes and signatures and cant be brute forcedhttpiimgurcomfyfbsqpjpg or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets

 designed money  bitcoin was created to fit all the fundamental properties of moneyhttpsimgurcomawla better than gold or fiat
 portable  bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold  they can be transported by simply carrying a seed a string of  to  words on a device or by memorizing it for wallet recoveryhttpsenbitcoinitwikibrainwallet while cool memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users  hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security
 low fee scaling  most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view fee estimateshttpsrivercomlearnhowbitcoinfeeswork and mempool activityhttpsjochenhoenickedequeuew if you want to set your fee manually  on chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the lightning networkhttpslightningnetwork an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the bitcoin blockchain the lightning network enables bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible

 securing your bitcoin

with bitcoin you can be your own bank and personally secure your bitcoin or you can use third party companies aka bitcoin banks which will hold your bitcoin for you

 if you prefer to be your own bank and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure if you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices then a hardware wallet such as a bitboxhttpsbitboxswissbitbox  trezorhttpswwwtrezorio coldcardhttpscoldcardwalletcom or blockstream jadehttpsblockstreamcomjade is recommended you can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a seedsignerhttpsseedsignercom or kruxhttpsselfcustodygithubiokrux

 if you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many software wallethttpsbitcoinorgenchooseyourwallet options to choose from depending on your use case  mobile wallets like bluewallethttpsbluewalletio are generally more secure than desktop wallets  beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable bitcoin websites  avoid paper wallets or brain wallets

 if you prefer to work with third party bitcoin banks to set up a collaborative custody arrangement try unchained capitalhttpsunchainedcapitalcom but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk  there is a saying in the community not your keys not your coins 

note for increased security use two factor authentication fa everywhere it is offered including email 

fa requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access  google authenticator and authy are the two most popular fa services download links are below  make sure you create backups of your fa codes

avoid using your cell number for fa  hackers have been using a technique called sim swapping to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges

google auth  authy  otp auth

ioshttpsitunesapplecomusappgoogleauthenticatoridmt  ioshttpsitunesapplecomusappauthyid  ioshttpsappsapplecomusappotpauthid  

physical security keys fido uf offer stronger security than google auth  authy and other totpbased apps because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bidirectional authentication so it prevents phishing if you lose the device though you could lose access to your account so always use  or more security keys with a given account so you have backups see yubikeyhttpsyubikeycom or titanhttpscloudgooglecomtitansecuritykey to purchase security keys

 running bitcoin

you can run bitcoin nodehttpsbitcoinstackexchangecomquestionswhatisabitcoinnode software by downloading and installing bitcoin corehttpsbitcoincoreorg or other node software you have vetted 

it is a best practice to verify these bitcoin node programs you download by checking their hashes and signatureshttpsyoutubeuiimsrosiqagrygpurzqacm 

dont trust verify

 httpsgithubcombitcoinbitcoinreleases
 httpsbitcoincoreorg
 httpsbitcoinorgenbitcoincore

a verified bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the bitcoin network they can be used alongside open source software walletshttpsenbitcoinitwikiwallet to send and receive bitcoin securely by running your own bitcoin node you enforce the bitcoin ruleset can verify transactions without trusted rd party middlemen improve your bitcoin privacy obtain independence with local access to blockchain data and help bolster the robustness of the bitcoin network by running a bitcoin node you are verifying that bitcoin is bitcoin for yourself for more details on running a bitcoin node see this articlehttpsunchainedcomblogwhyrunbitcoinnode 

for wallets used alongside your bitcoin node if your bitcoin wallet software is fully open sourcehttpsbitcoinstackexchangecomquestionsisbitcoincompletelyopensource and bitcoinonly then it is probably a decent wallet some popular examples include sparrow wallethttpssparrowwalletcom and electrum wallethttpselectrumorg both of which you can connect to your own locally run bitcoin node and use with most bitcoin hardware wallets

 watch out for scams

as mentioned above bitcoin is decentralized which by definition means there is no official website or twitter handle or spokesperson or ceo however all money attracts thieves this combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on youtube or social media many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of bitcoin websites like bitcoindotcom and the r  btc subreddit are active scams  almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin  so be careful any resource including all linked in this document may in the future turn evil  as they say in our community dont trust verify 

 avoid using adbased search engines like google or yahoo ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways  use duckduckgohttpsduckduckgocom instead which has no ads and never tracks you as well
 ignore private messages offering services
 never enter your seed words in a website of any kind hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface never on a website
 always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving  some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copyandpaste
 avoid clicking on links like that look like links such as httpswwwgooglecomhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvybwrkbme without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to  just because a link is labelled with an https address does not mean it actually sends you to that address  it is trivial for someone to comment a link on reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money

dont trust verify maya parbhoe the next bitcoin president of suriname,8,1jylfrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jylfrz/dont_trust_verify_maya_parbhoe_the_next_bitcoin/,0,2025-04-13 18:48:08,"dear bitcoin community

i was in suriname a few weeks ago with a goal in mind to meet the local btc community and hopefully the presidential candidate maya parbhoe this was my experience

while planning the trip i reached out to maya via her telegram channel to explore the possibility of meeting i was quickly referred to her assistant terance who responded promptly and told me to reach out once i arrived okay fair enough  who am i to demand time from someone running for president at the time i didnt yet know she was pregnant after all im not a famous bitcoin celebrity but i am a prominent figure in curaaos booming bitcoin community and had raised a considerable amount of funds for her campaign

a few days before my arrival i checked in again  same story when i finally landed and reached out while strolling through paramaribo  a city i hadnt visited in over a decade  i couldnt help but notice the drastic economic change the exchange rate had gone from  usd   srd during my last visit to  usd   srd now

terance replied quickly and said he was at a caf with another foreign guest apologies i forgot the persons name and nationality i took the opportunity and met them right away i was warmly welcomed and treated with genuine surinamese hospitality we talked for over an hour about our lives bitcoin journeys and ambitions

over the next few days i met up with terance again and had the pleasure of attending a lecturecourse hosted by the local btc sranan community  held above what im told is mayas business a parcel freight forwarding service from the us to suriname i had drinks and met various local merchants the lecture was given by an american missionary who moved to suriname years ago to teach and decided to stay his dedication and patience were truly inspiring  every educator should take note im extremely grateful for his efforts and for all of btc sranans work toward merchant adoption and bitcoin awareness

now to the topic of this post maya parbhoe

first and foremost im not in the business of destroying reputations im in the business of protecting ours  the true bitcoiners i want there to be a next bitcoin president and suriname certainly deserves one

but red flags were immediately raised when i asked the local bitcoiners about maya  they didnt want to talk about her strange right youd expect someone running for office under the bitcoin banner to be a welcomed topic but perhaps its better  and probably for the best  to separate the local bitcoin community from one persons political ambitions or so i thought

while there i dug deeper into her socalled political campaign and asked a variety of locals  from taxi drivers to businesspeople  about maya not a single one outside of bitcoin circles had heard of her when i brought up her political party the nps the general response was that its a minor insignificant party with no real chance of winning

a quick note on surinamese politics i wont go too deep here as im not intimately familiar with all the parties and political drama of past decades but its important to know that suriname is a parliamentary democracy voters elect a party not a candidate to represent them in parliament the legislative branch generally the winning party chooses the ministerpresident prime minister to lead the government maya is listed as  winkwink on the nps candidate list

additionally i could not find any mention of bitcoin in the official communications from the nps so clearly this isnt an official stance of the party red flag

so her claim that shes running for president of suriname is to put it mildly a massive stretch furthermore this narrative is only pushed to her international audience  through x nostr podcasts and events her local messaging mainly via facebook and local media is entirely different another red flag

now suriname is known for corruption  and for serious threats to individuals who oppose power mayas father was murdered in  reportedly connected to a money laundering and trafficking case where he had served as a whistleblower i confirmed this through archived articles so potential threats to her life should be taken seriously given the history and the current security climate

that said she had already begun claiming that there were threats against her  possibly based on the above but during my stay a new controversy arose she was summoned to testify in a human trafficking case involving the import of people from india to suriname odd she claims this is an attack by authorities aligned with the ruling party that might be true  but who really knows

also she was pregnant not the most ideal timing to begin a presidential campaign  especially your first child red flag

then came a flood of claims about threats political interference and safety concerns  which to be fair is part of politics but again the narratives were drastically different depending on the audience  local vs foreign just compare her facebook posts to what she shares on xnostr red flag

as i was leaving the country the security situation escalated she claimed to have hired  armed security  probably funded by international donations if true id consider that an unfortunate but understandable expense

but things got weirder i wont repeat all the welldocumented incidents  from cryptic social media posts to the bizarre sos xspace at one point she hired a professional security firm which quickly dropped her according to a reliable source the ceo bluntly stated they stopped working with her and warned others against doing so

then she made the outrageous claim that she was being protected by the us secret service or some equivalent this was so absurd it caught local media attention when questioned she said she made the post while medicated to ease pregnancy pains huge red flag

clearly the way she has raised international funds is to say the least misleading and if she truly believes in government transparency maya must start by being transparent herself justify where the donations went proof of funds please

i  and i suspect many of us  let wishful thinking get ahead of us

why gold wouldnt work in a multipolar world,49,1jy7c5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jy7c5t/why_gold_wouldnt_work_in_a_multipolar_world/,35,2025-04-13 08:13:09,"its as simple as this settlement in gold requires physical transport which requires navies and armies to secure and while international trade was guaranteed by the dominance of the british navy in the th century and the us navy thereafter without a global hegemon there would be no way to eliminate risk from the settlement procedure making settlement too expensive and too risky to be conducted frequently thus increasing the uncertainty of whether your country was going to get paid 

settlement in gold works fine if you rely on a tokenized system where digital tokens represent real gold in vaults as long as the third party holding the gold and accepting the tokens as redeemable are trusted but that is the problem in a multipolar world there is no universally trusted third party

this is why bitcoin becomes so significant in such a world because it would allow for the real settlement of trade while largely eliminating the risk and dramatically reducing the cost from conducting global trade"

they said it was a scam a ponzi told me i was wasting my time and money every time i brought it up it turned into an argument or a joke at my expense

fast forward to now and they finally get it

over the past couple of months theyve started asking questions not just surfacelevel stuff but real questions about fiat inflation saving and how bitcoin actually works theyve been learning about selfcustody hardware wallets now they even use lightning for small transactions such as buying produce at our local farmers market

its been wild watching them go from complete denial to setting up cold storage and talking about time preference and scarcity has honestly been emotional this thing that used to divide us is now something were exploring together

for anyone out there trying to help their family see what you see know this it takes time a lot of time but once it click it clicks

bitcoin is a game of patience,80,1jxt3fm,https://i.redd.it/z42s9in6chue1.png,33,2025-04-12 17:26:03,"if you try to time the market the odds are stacked against you heres why

if you exclude just the top  bestperforming days each year bitcoin would be down on average every single year yes you read that right and if you exclude the top  biggest pointgain days bitcoin would be down even more each year

this means that the majority of bitcoins gains come in just a handful of days  days you cannot predict if youre out of the market when those moments happen you miss out on the exponential upside

the lesson patience pays timing the market is nearly impossible but time in the market is what builds real wealth just like in the stock market the people who have earned big with btc arent the ones trying to trade every dip and spike theyre the ones who held through volatility ignored the noise and stayed focused on the longterm picture"

best decision of my life
that initial investment turned into my obsession i started researching everything i could about blockchain decentralization and investment strategies i set up automatic weekly buys with whatever i could spare  those small consistent purchases added up more than i ever imagined
when the  bull run hit my portfolio exploded i was smart enough to take some profits paid off k in student loans but kept most invested even through the crash and bear market my average buy price kept me well in the green
but the biggest change wasnt just financial  bitcoin completely shifted my mindset i went from someone who couldnt save a penny to someone thinking about longterm wealth building i started learning about traditional investing opened a roth ira and even got serious about my career to increase my income

youre still early a long form post as part of a bitcoin book project,34,1jx5wiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jx5wiz/youre_still_early_a_long_form_post_as_part_of_a/,8,2025-04-11 20:22:15,"a section i drafted as part of a small book about bitcoin for newbs all feedback welcome  


  
the bitcoin community points out that newcomers often think theyre too late people considering bitcoin for the first time look at the price history and think they missed their chance similarly especially during bitcoins most exciting times people look at the price and think its too expensive

the funny thing is thats been true since before  and a  price i know because i had those same thoughts back then and i expect people to have similar thoughts at  and then at  and then at 

one bitcoin went from buying  big macs in  to over  big macs in  it went from needing  bitcoin to buy a typical house in  to just  in  thats a huge jump but its also an ongoing trend  theres still a lot of room for bitcoin to grow even more in the future

new technologies tend to follow a predictable adoption curve starting with a small group of innovators and early adopters before gaining traction with the broader public as things improve

in  bryant gumbel a host of the popular today show stumbled through trying to understand an email address bryant asked what is internet anyway

his cohost katie couric responded internet is that massive computer network the one thats becoming really big now bryant asked what do you write to it like mail

the next year famous comedian david letterman had bill gates on his late night talk show letterman asked what about this internet thing do you know anything about that bill gates said sure and talked a bit about how it lets people publish information and send email letterman poked fun at gates the entire time 

when gates talked about the ability to listen to a baseball game online letterman jokingly asked have you heard of radio do tape recorders ring a bell gates went on to describe the most basics of social networking by that point letterman was laughing in his face and the crowd laughed along

in those days the internet was an emerging technology not yet mainstream i remember reading business magazines at the time  printed on paper they had articles with titles like is it time for you to put your business online then the entire article would explain all the reasons you shouldnt bother to have a website for your business

in  paul krugman a distinguished professor of economics said

the growth of the internet will slow drastically as the flaw in metcalfes lawwhich states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participantsbecomes apparent most people have nothing to say to each other by  or so it will become clear that the internets impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machines

ok it can be fun to look back at the early days of things and poke fun at the people who didnt understand what was coming 

but its also educational to look at how society initially reacts to new unfamiliar things as they emerge and grow there is always a some amount of fear uncertainty and doubt around new things

in  the internet had about  million users that was about  of the worlds population at the time ten years later  it was a bit over  billion users or about  of the worlds population another ten years  got it to well over  billion users  of world population today the internet has more than  billion users which is about  of the worlds population

the internet is not the only interesting new technology we can look at here are two others that made history



credit cards 

the idea of a small plastic card that lets you charge purchases started in the s before  credit cards were owned by about  million users worldwide that was about  of the worldwide adult population at the time by the end of the s they were used by about  million people or about  of the worlds adult population

in  a local tv news station went into a burger king restaurant in the us the restaurant had just started accepting credit cards the news station asked customers what they thought about using credit cards to buy burger king food 

one customer said i think its pretty bad if you have to use a credit card when you go to a fast food restaurant and then expressed concern that someone would have to call new york to confirm the transaction another customer said i just hope it doesnt slow things down a third customer a gray haired gentleman dressed in a suit and tie said i just cant imagine it working on a daytoday basis

about  million people owned credit cards at the time or about  of adults worldwide  million in the us or about  of adult americans

from there usage steadily increased today credit cards are used by about  billion people about  of adults worldwide  million in the us or about  of adult americans



smartphones

in  andy grove ceo of intel described the idea of a wireless personal communicator in every pocket as a pipe dream driven by greed the first smartphone was released back in  but only got about  users

but in  the iphone came out and the overall market quickly got to  million users worldwide or about  of the worlds population microsofts ceo at the time steve ballmer stated theres no chance that the iphone is going to get any significant market share

by  the overall smartphone market was at  billion users worldwide or about  of world population today were looking at almost  billion users about  of the planet



thats a basic review of several technologies that emerged in the past how does bitcoin compare

it can be difficult to pin down exactly how many people own bitcoin today but specialists at companies like chainalysis study data from bitcoin apps and conduct surveys to count users in the us and worldwide they report that about  million people own bitcoin today thats about  of the worlds population

thats roughly similar to  for credit cards or the late s for the internet or about  for smartphones

most people in the world dont own any bitcoin yet big companies and even governments are just now starting to take it seriously 

we recently passed the stage where steve balmer the ceo of microsoft said theres no chance that the iphone is going to get any significant market share weve just barely reached the stage where david letterman laughed at bill gates and suggested the internet was no more useful than radio and tape recorders were not yet at the stage where a burger king customer looked at the restaurants new credit card readers and said i just cant imagine it working on a daytoday basis

theres a long way to go before bitcoin really catches on

youre not late

for instance salt was used so much as money originally that it is the root for the word salary which comes from salarium meaning payment in salt

banco means bench or table medieval moneylenders sat at benches if a banker failed their bench was broken  banca rotta  bankrupt

credit is latin and means to believe or trust as in you believe someone will pay you back

fiat means let it be done or essentially i declare meaning i declare this has value

lets make a sentence and translate it

fiat money is created using credit roughly translates into i declare this newly made money has value and you believe that it will be paid back eventually

 the dollars decline may lead to a reevaluation of its status as the global reserve currency

every crypto investor should read the entirety of blackrocks letter on tokenization,269,1jxz46q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jxz46q/every_crypto_investor_should_read_the_entirety_of/,139,2025-04-12 22:59:28,"if you invest in crypto you cannot say youve done your research unless youve read this thesis on tokenization published by larry fink today in the annual investor letter for blackrock the worlds largest asset manager

for context blackrock manages over  trillion in assets and is one of the top shareholders in just about any company youve ever heard of they led the launch of bitcoin etfs followed by ethereum etfs they launched their buidl fund for onchain asset management which has already surpassed over b in aum on ethereum

do yourself a favor and read it below

tokenization is democratization

the worlds money moves through plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary
take the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift its the system that underpins trillions of dollars in global transactions every day and it works much like a relay race banks hand off instructions one by one meticulously checking details at each step that relay approach made sense in the s an analog era when the markets were much smaller and daily transactions were much fewer but today relying on swift feels like routing emails through the postal office

tokenization changes all that if swift is the postal service tokenization is email itselfassets move directly and instantly sidestepping intermediaries

what exactly is tokenization its turning realworld assetsstocks bonds real estateinto digital tokens tradable online each token certifies your ownership of a specific asset much like a digital deed unlike traditional paper certificates these tokens live securely on a blockchain enabling instant buying selling and transferring without cumbersome paperwork or waiting periods

every stock every bond every fundevery assetcan be tokenized if they are it will revolutionize investing markets wouldnt need to close transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds and billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy generating more growth

perhaps most importantly tokenization makes investing much more democratic

 it can democratize access
tokenization allows for fractional ownership that means assets could be sliced into infinitely small pieces this lowers one of the barriers to investing in valuable previously inaccessible assets like private real estate and private equity

 it can democratize shareholder voting
when you own a stock you have a right to vote on the companys shareholder proposals tokenization makes that easier because your ownership and voting rights are digitally tracked allowing you to vote seamlessly and securely from anywhere

 it can democratize yield
some investments produce much higher returns than others but only big investors can get into them one reason friction legal operational bureaucratic tokenization strips that away allowing more people access to potentially higher returns

one day i expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as etfsprovided we crack one critical problem identity verification

financial transactions demand rigorous identity checks apple pay and credit cards handle identity verification effortlessly billions of times a day trade venues like nyse and marketaxess manage to do the same for buying and selling securities but tokenized assets wont run through those traditional channels meaning we need a new digital identity verification system it sounds complex but india the worlds most populous country has already done it today over  of indians can securely verify transactions directly from their smartphones the takeaway is clear if were serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system championing tokenization alone wont suffice we must solve digital verification too"

like every year ive once again found myself filing taxes at the very last minute thanks to some entirely unjustified procrastinationand inevitably ive run into a situation

i purchased xlm back in  on binance and transferred it to coinbase on  i then sold all of the xlm on coinbase on  however the coinbase tax document lists the acquisition date as  the transfer date and it marks the resulting gains as a shortterm capital gain even though i originally bought the xlm over  years ago

from what i understand the acquisition date should be when i originally purchased the cryptonot when i transferred it am i correct im considering manually adjusting the acquisition date on the tax document to reflect the original purchase date would that be the right thing to do any suggestions

i think one of my friends is being scammed,54,1jxm5l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jxm5l1/i_think_one_of_my_friends_is_being_scammed/,123,2025-04-12 12:10:16,"hey everyone one of my good friends recently started crypto trading after being introduced by this woman claiming to be from singapore who works with a team of traders and analysts i also trade myself but primarily on the forex market

now theres a lot that i dont know specifically about the crypto side of trading but there were quite a few red flags i noticed from what he was telling me

 since starting hes apparently increased his initial investment more than fold from following this womans strategy i know theres a chance of seeing those kind of returns given the volatility in crypto if youre lucky but hes only been doing this for less than  months i dont see how a legitimate wellthought out strategy with proper risk management would generate these kind of returns i can understand if its someones first time and theyre doing this on their own basically gambling or yolo trading but this is someone elses strategy hes following whos supposed to be a professional a disciplined trader who knows what theyre doing wouldnt be encouraging the kinda leverage you would need to generate a fold return let alone encouraging him to deposit the amount of money that he did 

theres also a lot of jargon ive never heard before but after some explanation from my friend it still doesnt really make sense to me i dont know if maybe hes explaining it wrong but it just doesnt add up and its certainly not terminology that ive heard in trading before

for example hes supposed to be learning mining this coming week which i thought was referring to bitcoin mining but again either he didnt explain it well or this guru is feeding him a load of rubbish because his description of it sounded more vaguely like a hedge fund

i asked him if hes been able to make any withdrawals he hasnt made any yet but says hes in the process of doing so i fear that whoever these people are are simply taking money from people like him with no intentions of giving any of it back but since i know relatively very little about crypto i didnt immediately voice my concerns although now i really wish i did

theres probably some parts i missed but im going based off of what i remember from our phonecall yesterday

 i want to give my friend the best advice going forward but i want to relay that advice from someone who knows what theyre talking about any thoughts "

ive had my share of ups and downs in crypto losing k recently but making k a few years back like many of you i see crypto as a gamble but im fascinated by its potential im not a pro investor but im passionate about exploring the technology and what can be done with it  
  
my main expertise lies in building startups ive launched several some failed others succeeded giving me experience in scaling businesses now im working on something entirely new  mainstreaming realworld asset rwa tokenization through a dao focused on athletes careers   
  
the vision is to let people globally invest in and support athletes while being part of their journeyheres the idea athletes tokenize a portion of their career earnings and in return they commit to sharing a percentage of those earnings with the community and investors who supported them unlike speculative crypto trading this offers a more predictable and meaningful way to engage with blockchain  
  
im looking for up to  experienced investors to join our early testing phase this isnt about raising funds im offering early access to the platform and tokens for participation i dont need money the project has already secured several million usd in funding and were beyond that stage   
  
my goal is to ensure a successful launch by collaborating with people who share this vision and can provide valuable feedbackthe company is registered in dubai and were in the process of obtaining a vara license with plans to secure additional licenses required for listing   
  
ive also spoken with binance contacts whove given us a green light for a listing when we are ready now were ready to take this project out of the basement and scale it upif youre interested drop a comment with your questions or dm me for early access   
  
ill provide tokens you can use to invest in athletes careers on the platform 

ps it will take at least six months that athletes can list their carriers for tokenisation we have so far  pro athletes in the queue"

are all cryptocurrency etfs associated with particular coins im asking because i know coins come and go and i have no attachment with any ones in particular if there were an etf that managed buying and selling and coins as they wax and wain id consider paying some management fees to not try and keep up with that myself

does such an etf exist any recommendations"

had the rule gone into effect it would have forced defi protocolsmany of which are governed by code not companiesto comply with traditional tax reporting standards including collecting and submitting user data to the irs and prepare and submit das reporting over user proceeds this mandate presented an existential threat to defi which relies on anonymity selfcustody and peertopeer transactions many platforms would have been unable to comply due to the sheer absence of kyc know your customer infrastructure and developers could have faced legal risk simply for creating or maintaining opensource code

the implications for the us crypto community would have been severe developers might have fled to jurisdictions with more favorable regulatory climates capital would have followed and innovation in blockchainbased financial tools could have been stifled for years in effect the rule would have driven defi out of the ushanding the future of financial decentralization to other nations defi would be dead and us crypto investors would effectively be limited to trading on centralized exchanges 

the repeal signals a major win for the crypto industry and a recognition that overly aggressive regulation risks killing the very innovation it claims to protect with this rule overturned usbased builders investors and users can continue to participate in the growing defi ecosystem without fear of regulatory overreach its a critical step in ensuring that america remains a competitive and welcoming hub for web innovation if the irs wants to make up silly rules congress will need to rewrite new measures that actually synergize with a procrypto united states or otherwise risk another embarrassing repeal

more discussion to come on how this impacts your tax preparation and strategy in navigating this evolving ecosystem"

in summary thats a  gain by investing k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the top ten on january st including stablecoins for eight straight years

 comparison to sp 

im also tracking the sp  as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets

the sp  is down  so far in  so the initial k investment into crypto on new years day would be worth  had it been redirected to the sp

taking the same investonjanuarystofeachyear approach with the sp  that ive been documenting through the top ten crypto experiments the yields are the following

taken together the results for a similar approach with the sp

you want to own the most hated thing  arthur hayes says ethereum set to outrun solana as memecoin craze fades,68,1jwi7pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jwi7pl/you_want_to_own_the_most_hated_thing_arthur_hayes/,36,2025-04-11 00:10:41,"httpsdailyhodlcomyouwanttoownthemosthatedthingarthurhayessaysethereumsettooutrunsolanaasmemecoincrazefadeshttpsdailyhodlcomyouwanttoownthemosthatedthingarthurhayessaysethereumsettooutrunsolanaasmemecoincrazefades

bitmex founder arthur hayes believes ethereum ethhttpsdailyhodlcomcurrenciesethereum is likely to outperform solana solhttpsdailyhodlcomcurrenciessolana over the next leg of the cycle

in a new interview on the unchained podcast hayes sayshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzjvsygrgbg ethereum has a higher riskreward ratio compared to solana going forward

if you have a fresh unit of fiat of capital what do you do with it do you buy solana or do you buy eth right now given all the things that are happening and so i would say eth from a riskreward perspective is better

whenever you have a turn in the cycle you want to own the most hated thing because thats going to perform the best and you dont want to own the most loved thing from the previous cycle because thats going to perform the worst

thats not to say that solana is not going to go up a lot but relative to something else is it going to perform as well and so i think eth has sort of the market fundamentals to do very well in this next leg up because people hate it so much

hayes says that one of the factors limiting solanas upside potential is the fact that the narrative that powered solanas rally to a new alltime high in january is unlikely to reach similar heights of popularity

solana did very well on sort of the memecoin supercycle or whatever you want to call it over the last  months

but i think that yes there will be some meme coins that do well

but are we going to go back to where we were  months ago where everybody and their mother was just like slinging memecoins trying to find the  million market cap that goes to  million market cap and just handing hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to pumpfun

i dont think were going back there and so i think all that activity that was on solana based on memecoin trading wont be there and so the narrative of oh memecoin trading is amazing the antiventure capital way to participate in crypto is on solana therefore i need to own solana as the layer that hosted all that activity i think that narrative goes away"
